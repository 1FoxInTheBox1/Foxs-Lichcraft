As delightful as the [**{gold}Soul Masher{}**](^lichcraft:harvesting_souls) is, it is a bit crude.
A more sophisticated method of harvesting souls may prove more efficient.
Alchemy may be able to destroy an entity's body while leaving most of the soul intact.

By dissolving a [**{blue}Charged Soul Crystal{}**](^lichcraft:soul_materials) into an **Awkward Potion**,
I receive some **{gold}Potions of Reaping{}**

;;;;;

The potion is capable of destroying the body while saving the soul, but its damage leaves something to be desired.
If I wish to use these to harvest souls, I'll likely want to use a more mundane method to weaken a creature
before **finishing it off** with one of these.

**{gold}Potions of Reaping{}** can be turned into splash and lingering potions as normal, 
and enhanced with glowstone to increase their damage.
