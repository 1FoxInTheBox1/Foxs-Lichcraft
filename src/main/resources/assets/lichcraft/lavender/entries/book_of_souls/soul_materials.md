As I [previously observed](^lichcraft:soul_data), not all souls are made equal.
Some creatures have enough soul material within them that it crystallizes rather than turning to goop.
These **{blue}Soul Crystals{}** don't seem much more powerful than their slimy counterpart, granting the same number
of souls when added to a phylactery.

;;;;;

The most powerful creatures will also drop a potent **{blue}Soul Star{}** when killed with anything capable of harvesting souls.
**{blue}Soul Stars{}** provide **100x** as many souls as **{blue}Soul Goo{}**.

Kill the wither with a [**{gold}Soul Masher{}**](^lichcraft:harvesting_souls) is probably going to be tough.
Fortunately, humans also drop **{blue}Soul Stars{}**, so I can just **kill my friends** a few times.

;;;;;

A more automatable method is to enhance **{blue}Soul Goo{}** and **{blue}Soul Crystals{}**, allowing them to provide double souls to phylacteries.
