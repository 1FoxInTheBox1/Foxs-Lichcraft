To begin my path to becoming a **{blue}Lich{}**, I must first find materials capable of collecting souls. 
Currently, slain creatures' souls appear to simply fade into nothingness. 
I begin my search for soul harvesting materials by considering the various magical resources of this world.

;;;;;

I would suspect **gold**'s enchantability makes it a good candidate.
Combine that with **sculk**'s natural absorbtion of life energy and **soul sand**'s... uh, *souliness*, and I should get
a material with the desired properties.

;;;;;

Small experiments with the resulting {gold}**Dread Steel**{} reveal two of its properties.
Firstly, that it can in fact harvest souls. Rather than dissipating, a creature who is slain by this
material has its soul condensed into a goopy substance I call **{blue}Soul Goo{}**.
Although it's quite gross, this marks my first step into {blue}Lichcraft{}.

;;;;;

However, it is even weaker than gold, which suggests that making tools from it is a bad idea.
Though with its weight I could probably just drop a big hunk of it on an unsuspecting creature.

;;;;;

The **{gold}Soul Masher{}** is a blunt but effective tool. When placed by a **player** or a **dispenser**,
it will fall and crush anyone unfortunate enough to be standing under it. Like sand or gravel, it will **automatically
break** when it falls on a torch, slab, or similar tile. This means I should be able to create a nice loop of continuously
falling **{gold}Soul Mashers{}** to farm souls.

;;;;;

And unlike its iron brethren, the anvil, the **{gold}Soul Masher{}** **will never break**, 
although it can't be used for forging. It also doesn't seem to do quite as much damage as the anvil.
The **{gold}Soul Masher{}** makes up for this by gaining damage much faster, meaning **less fall distance is
necessary** for a lethal blow.
