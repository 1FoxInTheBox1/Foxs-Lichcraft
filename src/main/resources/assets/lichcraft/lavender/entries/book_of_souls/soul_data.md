Crushing various creatures with the [**{gold}Soul Masher{}**](^lichcraft:harvesting_souls) has revealed that
not all souls are made equal. Animals appear to give very little soul material, and some creatures, such
as the undead and constructs, give no souls at all. 

;;;;;

The general rule seems to be that passive animals, such as pigs, cows, and various fish give only a few souls.

Constructs, such as iron golems and blazes, and undead such as zombies and skeletons have no souls to collect.
Creepers, being oddly lively plant life, also give no souls.

;;;;;

It seems like I'll need to turn my attention to more sentient, and more difficult, targets. 
Villagers and Pillagers both seem like good options. Piglins also appear to possess more substantial souls.

In general, this category is composed of civilized creatures and those with minor magical abilities, such as
Endermen or even Ghasts.

;;;;;

If I need even more soul material per creature, I'll need to look towards hose well versed in magic.

Pillagers are the only being who seem interested in this topic other than other humans, so Evokers or Witches
would be the go-to targets.

;;;;;

If I still need more souls, I'll need to turn to the most powerful beings of this world.
The Ender Dragon, Wither, and Warden are all exceptionally powerful creatures that I theorize
possess **extremely potent souls**.

Hitting any of those 3 with a magical anvil seems unlikely, *but there is another target*...

;;;;;

I have heard of Liches constructing vast dungeons designed to lure in adventurers and then harvest their souls.
If I could build a similar structure and bring another human to it, I could crush them with a [**{gold}Soul Masher{}**](^lichcraft:harvesting_souls).
While this would be difficult to pull off, humans are the only beings capable of bringing their full imagination into
this world. For that reason I suspect that **a human soul would rival the most powerful entities**.
