The source of a Lich's power of death comes from their **{light_purple}Phylactery{}**. The souls they harvest are placed in
this device, and if a Lich should die, they will simply reform with their equipment near the phylactery.

However, this requires a massive amount of magical power. 

;;;;;

[**{blue}Soul Goo{}**](^lichcraft:harvesting_souls) won't cut it.
I'll need to boost its power. 
Perhaps the soul-resonanting properties of **sculk** can help once again?

<recipe;lichcraft:echoing_goo>

{gray}"again?... again?... again?..."{}

;;;;;

The **Echo Shards** that can be found in Ancient Cities also seem to react to death.
By combining this with {blue}**Echoing Goo**{} and some [**{gold}Dread Steel{}**](^lichcraft:harvesting_souls), 
I can make the core of my phylactery.

<recipe;lichcraft:resonant_slag>

{gray}"At least it doesn't require a nether star"{}

;;;;;

I expected some mystical, glowing power core. Instead, I got **{blue}Resonant Slag{}**.
Although it's a bit gross looking, it should still be capable of holding souls once I give it a container.

<recipe;lichcraft:phylactery>

;;;;;

Finally, my **{light_purple}Phylactery{}** is complete. By **right-clicking** the simple looking jar with
any {blue}soul material{}, it should get absorbed into the phylactery.
I don't think there's a way to get them out once that happens, but that's probably alright.
I can also set my spawn at it, like a respawn anchor.
Finally, I can fill the phylactery automatically with **hoppers**.

;;;;;

The **{light_purple}Phylactery{}** can store up to **5 revives** worth of souls in it. 
An attached comparator will give off a redstone signal proportional to how many times it can revive me at that moment

Adding more souls than the **{light_purple}Phylactery{}** can hold will simply destroy the added souls, so **be careful not to overfill**.
Breaking the block also dissipates any contained souls, but the block will be returned.

;;;;;

Like I observed earlier, stacks upon stacks of soul material are required to get a single revive.
That being said, this seems to sometimes vary. Something about modpack authors, and config files... and datapacks?
Not sure what all that means. I guess there is some magical knowledge that is beyond even my ken.
