Lichcraft is a Fabric mod for Minecraft allowing players to harvest souls from certain creatures to craft and power a phylactery. 
This phylactery acts as both a regular spawnpoint, as well a sort of "emergency escape" that prevents your death and teleports you to it

#### Features
- A guidebook to explain the mod's major mechanics
- Harvest souls from creatures with the Soul Crusher or with Potions of Reaping
- Use souls to craft a phylactery
- Respawn at your phylactery normally, or power it with souls to avoid truly dying (Great for hardcore worlds!)

#### Building
To build Fox's Lichcraft locally:
1. Clone the repository
